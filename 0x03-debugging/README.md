# 0x03. C - Debugging

In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.

Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling. Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as debuggers.






## Learning Objectives

* What is debugging

* What are some methods of debugging manually

* How to read the error messages






## Task : 

### 0. Multiple mains :
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.


* You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.

* You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.




###  1. Like, comment, subscribe :
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

* Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

* You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.




### 2. 0 > 972? :
This program prints the largest of three integers.


? That’s definitely not right.

Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
* Line count will not be checked for this task.




### 3. Leap year :
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000.

Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

* Line count will not be checked for this task.

* You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).

* You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).

* You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
