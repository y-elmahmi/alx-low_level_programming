# 0x09. C - Static libraries
This project focuses on the concept of static libraries in C. A static library is a collection of object files that are linked with a program at compile time. Static libraries provide a way to share code between different programs, making development and maintenance easier.


## Learning Objectives
* What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it

* Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm



## Tasks :

### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed below:

* If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the right prototype.
* Don’t forget to push your main.h file to your repository. It should at least contain all the prototypes of the above functions.

### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
